# What's For Dinner app (dinner for short)

Developed for my family's use to help with scheduling dinners and groceries.
It is intended to make life easier to manage one of those things that everyone
needs to do, eat dinner. The aim is to have this application make it easier to
schedule meals that the family will like, coordinate grocery needs, and to save
money by not eating out due to poor planning, (that gets expensive).

It is an ongoing development, but if it gets to the point where it would be useful
generally, perhaps I'll put it out 'there'.
